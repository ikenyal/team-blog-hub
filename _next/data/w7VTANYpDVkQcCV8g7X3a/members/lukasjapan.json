but my parents never allowed me to have a Super Nintendo.I guess that is what you get when you spend too much time with your handheld console but not enough time with your homework.","link":"https://blog.cvguy.de/2020/the-supernintendo-retropi-casemod/","isoDate":"2020-08-17T08:27:00.000Z","dateMiliSeconds":1597652820000,"authorName":"lukasjapan","authorId":"lukasjapan"},{"title":"Distinguishing

distinguish between cat and dog images.I didn't go so far to submit my result to Kaggle, but instead, I gave myself the challenge to solve the problem within a completely different technology stack

code.","link":"https://blog.cvguy.de/2017/fast-ai-course-on-macmini/","isoDate":"2017-10-01T13:22:00.000Z","dateMiliSeconds":1506864120000,"authorName":"lukasjapan","authorId":"lukasjapan"},{"title":"Building
